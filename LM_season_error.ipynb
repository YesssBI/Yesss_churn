We have variables for slope, intercept and spend, but we can add absolute error and even express that as a percentage of spend. We can also add a value for the absolute value of our coefficient. The best way to test the value of these further variables (as well as the whole model) will be in a lASSO model which will show shrinkage for variables with lower explanatory power."
